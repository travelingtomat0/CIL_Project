# CIL_Project
Project for the course "Computational Intelligence Laboratory"

# Project Description
Goal of the project was implementing and testing a movie recommendation system based on collaborative information: user ratings for movies.

# Model
Our proposed model implements multiple machine learning models (deep learning architectures, probabilistic LSA models, standard data imputation methods) in a stacked ensemble methods.

Model weights of the ensemble are learned using non-convex optimization on a constrained loss function. For more information on the model and evaluation, see our attached paper.
